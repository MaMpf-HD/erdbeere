  title: $R$ left Noetherian, $M$ f.g. $R$-Module â‡’ $M$ Noetherian
  text: >-
    As $R$ is left Noetherian, it is also Noetherian as a left module
    over itself. A standard devissage argument shows that $R^n$ is
    also Noetherian for every natural number $n$, and choosing a
    surjection $R^n\longrightarrow M\longrightarrow 0$ implies the
    proposition.
